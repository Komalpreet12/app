                <p>The first step is discovery. It refers to thinking and
                    brainstorming all possible routes and looking at the
                    problem from different angles. In order to create a
                    solution, we need to know the problem very well, the ins
                    and outs. As for the things we can’t see, we use
                    prediction.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="column__right">
                <p>The next step is to strategize. Just like an army going
                    to battle, we must have a strategy of attack. We create the
                    best strategy to move forward based on the research that
                    was conducted in the first step.</p>

        <div class="step fadeIn">
            <div class="column__left">
                <div class="step__number">
                    <h5>Production</h5><span>03</span>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="column__right">
                <p>The third step is creation. Once we have a clear view of
                    where we’re going, we go full force in that direction. We
                    produce.</p>

        <div class="step fadeIn">

                    <h5>Implementation</h5><span>04</span>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="column__right">
                <p>The fourth step is to implement. Once we hit our
                    milestones, we take a step back and test what we’ve
                    created. We ask ourselves - “Does this solve the problem in
                    the best way possible? Is this the best we can do?” If the
                    answer is no, then we get back to work.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="column__right">
                <p>The final product is the masterpiece that comes from
                    following these steps thoroughly. Like all things, creation
                    is the means of getting better. With our continuous effort
                    to create better ideas and push innovation forward, there
                    is always room for improvement and growth.</p>
